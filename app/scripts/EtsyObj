CHECK YOUR SPAM FOLDER \r\n\r\nNote: 95% of the time orders placed by Thursday are delivered by that following Friday. If this wasn&#39;t helpful, send us an email, as we are no longer doing after-sales support directly on Etsy. \r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTION: MY ORDER ARRIVED BROKE, ENGRAVED WRONG, ETC.

We reserve the right to ship from either shops. \r\n\r\n*Ordering samples before a large order is prudent; however owing to the nature of our business, we cannot guarantee a sample and the final production will look &quot;exactly&quot; alike as we have different machinist and many machines that all engrave \/ print slightly different. If getting &quot;exact&quot; is critical, please let us know at order so we can find the previous order documents and make sure we use the same machinist to engrave the order.

So, let me bake for you - enjoy - indulge !\r\n\r\nABOUT WHY WEIGHT BARS\r\nI have been using Garcinia Cambogia in my Why Weight Bars since 2007 and this is the first time it has been given credit on national T.V. FYI watch the attached video.\r\nMake the most of your time and do something good for yourself. Raise the bar on weight  with the power of our Acai Berry Brownie Bars!\r\n\r\nCurb the urge to snack between meals, get a stamina boost, look good and feel even better. Saving the world just got slimmer, trimmer and sexier!\r\n\r\nAcai Berries Suppress Appetite\r\n\r\nThe hardest part of living a healthy lifestyle is resisting the temptations to eat those tasty snacks. The Acai Berry is rich in fiber and omega 6 & 9 fats promoting a healthy metabolism. This is an all natural solution to temper those little snack cravings between meals.\r\n\r\nAcai Berry is a Natural Energy Booster\r\n\r\nUnlike energy drinks or pills that are filled with caffeine and dangerous chemicals, the Acai Berry is 100% natural. Increased energy is one of its most noted side effects and the benefits are not negated by a crash (like energy drinks) that makes you feel worse than before you took it.\r\n\r\nIncrease Metabolism with the Acai Berry\r\n\r\nStudies have shown a direct link to the Acai Berry and an increase in your body\u2019s metabolic rate. This speeds up caloric burn and flushes the toxins that decrease energy and make you feel bloated.\r\n\r\nOne of the coolest aspects of this however is that Acai is a natural and organic product so unlike the synthetic lab created products you see advertised on TV and in magazines, Acai will keep your metabolism running strong all day without any of the jittery side effects!\r\n\r\nFat Fighting Fiber\r\n\r\nWhen fiber is eaten it swells in the stomach creating a filling quality. The body must work harder to digest high fiber foods, which speeds up the metabolism and burns calories faster.\r\n\r\nIt also acts as a digestive cleanser which helps in the removal of fat before your body can absorb it.\r\n\r\nThe Bottom Line\r\n\r\nYou will be hard pressed to find a better product on the market then Acai Berry to aid in fast, effective, and healthy weight .\r\n\r\nNow you too can enjoy the wonderful baked goods here on Etsy without feeling guilty about taking in those extra calories. Enjoy along with them, my wholesome Why Weight Bars with Acai Berry and Brindle Berries, Super Fruit and made with Gluten Free Grains and Organic Fruits and Nuts.Just 1 per day for less than the cost of an energy bar from your local gas station. \r\n\r\nYou will notice from the photos of the already baked bars, that they have a purplish cast to them. I mention this because I know you have a great sense of color here on Etsy. The cast is coming from the ground Acai pulp and there is quite a bit in each batch. Acai berries are pictured above and the richer and  fresher they are, the blacker they are. I use Acai in everything I make with the exception of the children&#39;s bars. It is a Super Duper Fruit.\r\n\r\nThey are made to order in my licensed and inspected kitchen and have at least  a 60 day shelf life because they are Vegan and there are no animal products of any kind in them to spoil\r\n. Remember to drink lots of water with your bar to get the nutrients into your system. Green tea is wonderful too, as a companion product for these bars. The more water or Green tea, the better.  We recommend that your bars be stored in a cool dry location. \r\nNuff said!\r\nThank you again and if you have any questions at all, please give me a holler.    \r\n                                                                                                                  Janet Best                    \r\n","currency_code":"USD","is_vacation":false,"vacation_message":"I am catching up on orders for the holidays and have to take a break from selling until II am ahead .

Insurance included.\r\n3)  EXPRESS $26.45 upgrade - Next day (or same day if possible) turnaround and EXPRESS shipping (typically 1-2 day service).  1-3 days to your door from placing order.  Insurance Included.\r\n\r\nPlease keep in mind RUSH EXPRESS is the only shipping option guaranteed by USPS!  You can purchase any of these shipping upgrades at check-out under &quot;Shipping&quot; if needed.\r\n\r\nINSURANCE: Please note that PRIORITY, RUSH & EXPRESS services include insurance for lost or damaged mail.  Standard shipping does NOT include insurance.  Please purchase an upgraded shipping option if you wish to insure your package!\r\n\r\nUSPS and I have a love\/hate relationship.  I love their prices (and so do you) but I hate it when they don&#39;t deliver on time.  Ug.  Which takes me to my next point--\r\nUSPS DOES NOT GUARANTEE ANY SHIPPING TIMES WITH THE EXCEPTION OF EXPRESS.  Sad but true.  Express in most cases, is overnight delivery and is a flat rate of $21.45 to US residents.  For those of you willing to fork it over, please message me for Express delivery option.  Keep in mind if you need 2 day turnaround to your door--you&#39;d need to purchase the RUSH option as well.  This bumps you to the front of every line.\r\n\r\nUSPS recognizes M-F as considered &quot;Postal Business Days&quot;.  Please keep this in mind when doing the math on when to expect your order!\r\n\r\nSo in a nutshell:\r\n\r\nStandard Shipping (5-7 business days to your door)\r\nPRIORITY Shipping (4-6 business days to your door)\r\nRUSH Shipping (3-4 business days to your door)\r\nEXPRESS Shipping (2 business days to your door excluding extreme rural areas which is 3 business days) USPS guarantees this method or your shipping money back.  Purchase an upgraded shipping option to insure your package.\r\n\r\nI have had very few issues or delays with the USPS however it does happen.  Typically 5 out of every 100.  I take a lot of pride in my labels as they are all edited one at a time--Trust me when I say I would hand deliver them if I could! :)\r\n\r\nINTERNATIONAL SHIPPING:\r\nInternational shipping is typically 2-3 weeks depending on its destination and how long it takes to process through customs (which always varies.)  USPS does not guarantee these shipping times and from time-to-time there are significant delays in Customs.  USPS does offer guaranteed services (which are super expensive but again, guaranteed.)  Please message me directly if you are interested in International guaranteed USPS delivery. \r\n\r\n7-11 Day RUSH International Ship (Business Days) \t$30.50 USD\r\n9-14 Day International Shipping (Business Days) \t$25.50 USDD\r\n4-6 Day RUSH International Shipping \t$45.75 USD\r\n\r\n***PLEASE NOTE from time to time International buyers are forced to pay customs fees and\/or taxes that are levied on many packages being imported into some countries.  Because sellers are unable to predict what fees, if any, certain countries will apply, Etsy does not hold sellers responsible for unexpected customs fees or taxes.  In my experience I have only seen this through Royal Mail.  Just a heads up!","policy_refunds":"Due to the custom nature of the product, we cannot offer refunds, returns or exchanges once the design process has begun.
